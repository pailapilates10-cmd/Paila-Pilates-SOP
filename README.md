# Paila Pilates — Client Portal & SOP Handbook

This repository is the public-safe presentation layer for the Paila Pilates owner/client-facing digital gateway.

## Live architecture

- `/` — Client Portal home
- `/sop/` — SOP / Operations Handbook
- Customer Portal — linked externally to the separate `pailapilates10-cmd/Paila-Pilates.com` repository and GitHub Pages site
- Business Systems — operational source reconciliation pending; no public owner-facing presentation is published here yet
- Reports — no approved portal published yet
- Future Systems — added only when a real, approved system exists

## Repository files

- `index.html` — Client Portal home
- `portal.css` — Client Portal visual system
- `portal.js` — Client Portal lightweight runtime
- `version.json` — current visible version and fallback lineage
- `CHANGELOG.md` — milestone and version history
- `sop/index.html` — searchable SOP directory; individual SOP and topic pages live alongside it
- `styles.css` — SOP Handbook styling
- `sop/handbook.js` — search, filters, navigation and legacy fragment handling
- `sop/handbook.css` — responsive handbook layout
- `sop/catalog.json` — public procedure metadata and preserved presentation-source reference

## Versioning and rollback

GitHub Pages stays on `main` → `/(root)`.

Branches are **not** used as website navigation. They are behind-the-scenes development or fallback references. The pre-portal SOP milestone is preserved at:

- commit `b22cf439a3d3457b66c8174f27a97744ab283f99`
- branch `milestone/sop-handbook-v0.1.0`

Every commit remains part of Git history, so individual changes can be inspected or restored. Named milestones provide an easier rollback pointer.

## Authority model

- Google Drive / approved business sources: business and operational source authority
- GitHub: version-controlled public/client-safe presentation code
- GitHub Pages: public-safe presentation layer
- Restricted operational material remains in approved private systems

## Public repository rule

Never commit passwords, API keys, private customer/member information, health information, payment records, staff personal information, confidential security procedures, private operational workbooks, or internal credentials.

## Current version

See `version.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`.


## Review boundary

The four SOP records retain their existing Draft/Planned status. Missing owners, approvers, scope and effective/review dates are explicit. Publishing this interface does not approve its procedures.
